# Welcome to ERApkg, a MATLAB package specifically designed to download and
# analyse ERA reanalysis data.  This package is meant to automate the
# process of downloading, resort and display specific ERA5 datasets, and
# can be customized to include other reanalysis datasets that were not
# utilized by the creator.
#
# ERApkg requires certain MATLAB toolboxes, as listed below:
# - M_Map (see https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/map.html)
# - Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (MATLAB)
# - Image Processing Toolbox (MATLAB)
# - Financial Instruments Toolbox (MATLAB)
# - Parallel Computing Toolbox (MATLAB) | Optional
